# Gmapslocale

> Track how Google tracks you

GMapsLocale, _no matter how poorly named it may be,_ a tool for visualizing your collected Google Location History data with heatmaps. Don't worryâ€”all processing and visualization happens directly on your computer, so rest assured that nobody is able to access your Location History but you... and Google, of course.
